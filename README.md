## Example Python package

This package was created to be used in the
[Python Packaging Publishing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-packaging-publishing/)
lesson of the [Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/). It is supposed to represent a typical
Python project that is a bit messy and needs to be organised.
