## Example Python package

This package was created to be used in the
[Python Packaging Publishing](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-packaging-publishing/)
lesson of the [Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/). It is supposed to represent a typical
Python project that is a bit messy and needs to be organised.

The project is a data analysis project on the Gapminder dataset, that is also used in the
[Python Novice Gapminder](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) lesson. There are
a few different types of files:
* raw data files;
* analysis notebooks;
* Python files with pre-made functions;
* auxiliary files such as this README.

The goal here is to try and make the project a little more organised. Feel free to create directories, move files
around, and rename them.
